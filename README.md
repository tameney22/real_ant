# Real Ant

Resources for working with the Real Ant project minus the actual reinforcement learning. This repository consists of code that allows you to interact with any number of [Dynamixel AX-12A](https://www.robotis.us/dynamixel-ax-12a/) servos.

## Code Description

### `Ax12` Class

This module allows you to connect to the AX-12A servos then read and write to the various registers that contain information about the servos' current & goal position, LED light, moving speed, and much more.

The original class can be [found here](https://github.com/aakieu/ax12_control), and worked for this usecase with little modification.

### `movement.py`

This module consists of functions for moving the collection of servos on the ant. These utility functions can be used to move a single servo or a collection of servos to perform an action like sitting or standing.

**IMPORTANT:** The servo ids should be configured to be numbers between 1-8 and arranged in a specific order for the various movements to work out of the box.

### `changeID.py`

This is a short script that allows you to connect a single servo and configure the ID associated with it.

### `moveAnt.py`

This script simply connects to the ant and sends some tester function calls to get it to perform the various tasks we have defined.

### `singleServo.py`

Short script to display a TKinter window to control a single AX-12A's speed and position.

### `app.py` + `templates/index.html`

This is a simple Flask server that serves a webpage on your local network that allows you to interact with the ant.

**WARNING:** Wait for the ant to stop moving before sending another command. Otherwise, it will not perform the action as intended and risks the legs getting tangled.
